            through long days and tired hands, you gave me a place to focus and a reason to keep going. you didnt promise perfection
            only growth. and in chasing that, i found parts of myself i didnt know were there.
            <br><br>
            No matter where life takes me next, a piece of me will always remember the sounds of the court and the quite lessons you 
            gave. thank you for the journey.

            <b>Dear: basketball</b><br><br>
            You were there before the noise, before the pressure, before anyone was watching, you taught me patience,
            dicipline, and how to fall and get back up again. every bounce echoed effort, every miss pushed me to try harder,
            and every small victory felt earned
            <br><br>
            through long days and tired hands, you gave me a place to focus and a reason to keep going. you didnt promise perfection
            only growth. and in chasing that, i found parts of myself i didnt know were there.
            <br><br>
            No matter where life takes me next, a piece of me will always remember the sounds of the court and the quite lessons you 
            gave. thank you for the journey.
            <br><br>
            <b>Always, me</b>
